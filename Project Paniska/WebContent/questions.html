    <h1>Interview Questions</h1>
    
    <h2 class="topic">Java</h2>
    <div class="java content">
        
        <h3 class="question">Java Data Structures:</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Enumeration</li>
                <li>BitSet</li>
                <li>Vector</li>
                <li>Stack</li>
                <li>Dictionary</li>
                <li>Hashtable</li>
                <li>Properties</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">What is a "static" modifier?</h3>
        <div class="answer">Static keyword makes variables or methods independent of anyinstance. It allows you to not create an instance of a class to use its methods and variables. Example, you can call a static method of another class without making an instance of it's class.Only one copy of the static variable exists regardless of the number of instances of the class.</div>
        <h3 class="question">"final" modifier</h3>
        
        <div class="answer">
            <li><strong>final variables</strong> can only be initialized once.</li>
            <li><strong>final methods</strong> cannot be overridden by any subclasses.</li>
            <li><strong>Final class</strong> main purpose is to prevent the class from being subclassed(it can not be extended).</li>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">"abstract" modfier</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <li><strong>abstract class</strong> can NEVER be instantiated. If the class is declared as abstract then the sole purpose of the class is to be EXTENDED. An abstract class can have obtain abstract methods or normal methods.</li>
            <span class="sideNote">If a class has an abstract method then the class must be declared abstract too.</span>
            <li><strong>abstract method</strong> is a method without any implementation. The methods body is provided by the subclass. Any class that extends and abstract class must implement all the abstract methods of the superclass,unless the subclass is also an abstract class.</li>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">"synchronized" modifier</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <span class="sideNote"> It can be applied with any access level modifer(ex, public synchronized void methodName()).</span>
            Synchronized keyword is used to indicate that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time.
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Difference between interface and abstract class</h3>
        <div class="answer"><li>Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior.</li>
        <li>Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.</li>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">Tagging Interfaces</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            An interface with no methods in it is referred to as a <strong>tagging interface</strong>. There are two
            basic design purposes of tagging interfaces:
            <li><strong>Creates a common parent:</strong> As with the EventListener interface, which is extended by
            dozens of other interfaces in the Java API, you can use a tagging interface to create a
            common parent among a group of interfaces. For example, when an interface extends
            EventListener, the JVM knows that this particular interface is going to be used in an event
            delegation scenario.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Adds a data type to a class:</strong> This situation is where the term, tagging comes from. A
            class that implements a tagging interface does not need to define any methods (since the
            interface does not have any), but the class becomes an interface type through
            polymorphism.</li>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">Array List vs HashMap</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> ArrayList implements List Interface while HashMap is an implementation of Map interface. List and Map are two entirely different collection interfaces.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Memory consumption:</strong> ArrayList stores the element’s value alone and internally maintains the indexes for each element.
            <br>
            HashMap stores key & value pair. For each value there must be a key associated in HashMap. That clearly shows that memory consumption is high in HashMap compared to the ArrayList.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Order:</strong> ArrayList maintains the insertion order while HashMap doesn’t. Which means ArrayList returns the list items in the same order in which they got inserted into the list. On the other side HashMap doesn’t maintain any order, the returned key-values pairs are not sorted in any kind of order.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Duplicates:</strong> ArrayList allows duplicate elements but HashMap doesn’t allow duplicate keys (It does allow duplicate values).</li>

            <li><strong>Nulls:</strong> ArrayList can have any number of null elements. HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.</li>
            
            <li><strong>get method:</strong> In ArrayList we can get the element by specifying the index of it. In HashMap the elements is being fetched by specifying the corresponding key.</li>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">ArrayList Vs LinkedList</h3>
        <div Class="answer">
            <h2 class="question">Similarities:</h2>
            <li>Both ArrayList and LinkedList are implementation of List interface.</li>
            <li>They both maintain the elements insertion order which means while displaying ArrayList and LinkedList elements the result set would be having the same order in which the elements got inserted into the List.</li>
            <li>Both these classes are non-synchronized and can be made synchronized explicitly by using Collections.synchronizedList method.</li>
            <li>The iterator and listIterator returned by these classes are fail-fast (if list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator’s own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException).</li>
            
            <h2 class="question">When to use LinkedList and when to use ArrayList?</h2>
            <li>Insert and remove operations give good performance (O(1)) in LinkedList compared to ArrayList(O(n)). Hence if there is a requirement of frequent addition and deletion in application then LinkedList is a best choice.</li>
            
            <li>Search (get method) operations are fast in Arraylist (O(1)) but not in LinkedList (O(n)) so If there are less add and remove operations and more search operations requirement, ArrayList would be your best bet.</li>
            
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">Serialization
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be represented
            as a sequence of bytes that includes the object's data as well as information about the
            object's type and the types of data stored in the object.</p>
            <p>After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read from the file and
            deserialized that is, the type information and bytes that represent the object and its data
            can be used to recreate the object in memory.
            </p>
            <p>Most impressive is that the entire process is JVM independent, meaning an object can be
            serialized on one platform and deserialized on an entirely different platform.</p>

    <h2 class="topic">JavaScript</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <h3 class="question">What is the drawback of creating true private methods in JavaScript?</h3>
        
        <div class="answer">
            One of the drawbacks of creating true private methods in JavaScript is that they are very memory-inefficient, as a new copy of the method would be created for each instance.
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">What is a “closure” in JavaScript? </h3>
        <div class="answer">
            A closure is a function defined inside another function (called the parent function), and has access to variables that are declared and defined in the parent function scope.
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            use strict is a way to voluntarily enforce stricter parsing and error handling on your JavaScript code at runtime. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions. In general, it is a good practice.
            <ul>
                <li>Makes debugging easier</li>
                <li>Prevents accidental globals</li>
                <li>eliminates <strong>this</strong> coercion</li>
                <li>Disallows duplicate property names or parameter values.</li>
                <li>Makes eval() safer</li>
                <li>Throw error on invalid usage of delete.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="question">What is eval()?</h3>
        
        <div class="answer">eval() is a function property of the global object.
        <br/>
        The argument of the eval() function is a string. If the string represents an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument represents one or more JavaScript statements, eval() evaluates the statements.</div>

        <h3 class="question">What does a doctype do?</h3>
        <div class="answer"> It gives instruction to the web browser on about what version of the markup language the page is written in. </div>
        <h3 class="question">What's the difference between full standards mode, almost standards mode and quirks mode?</h3>
        <div class="answer"> These are the 3 modes used by the layout engine.
            <li>In quirks mode layout emulate nonstandard behavior in IE5. This is essential for the websites that are build before the widespread of web standards.</li>
            <li>In full standards mode the behavior is the behavior described by HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>In almos standards mode there are only a small number of quirks implemented</li>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">What are data- attributes good for?</h3>
        <div class="answer"> Allows to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements. </div>
        <h3 class="question">What is progressive rendering?</h3>
        <div class="answer"> A rendering mode in which program gradually updates small parts of the entire image refining it from low quality to final result rather than focusing on one small part of the image at a time. </div>
        <h3 class="question">Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.</h3>
        <div class="answer">All 3 are used to store data on the client side Each one has it's own storage and expiration limit.
            <li><strong>localstorage</strong> store data with no expiration date, and gets cleaned only through Javascript, or clearing browser cache.</li>
            <li><strong>sessionStorage</strong> similar to localStorage but expires when the browser closes.Not when the tab is closed but when the broswer closes.</li>
            <li><strong>cookies</strong> stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subserquent requests. It is primarily for reading server-side.</li>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Describe the difference between script, script async and script defer</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            <li><strong>script</strong> The html file will be parsed until the script is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file. The scrip will wbe executed before parsing is resumed.</li>
            <li><strong>script async</strong> downloads during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.</li>
            <li><strong>script defer</strong> downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it wafter the parser has completed. Defere scripts are also guaranteed to execute in thw order that they appear in the document.</li>
